# PII Privacy Protection System - Final Year Project

## 🎓 Academic Project Overview

**Title:** Functional Dependency-Based Privacy Masking for PII Protection  
**Academic Year:** 2024-2025  
**Department:** Computer Science & Engineering  
**Project Type:** Final Year Capstone Project  

## 🚀 Project Description

This project presents an innovative approach to Personally Identifiable Information (PII) protection through functional dependency analysis. Unlike traditional privacy systems that mask all detected entities, our system intelligently determines which entities are functionally required for query processing and masks only those that are not essential.

## 🧠 Key Innovation

- **Smart Masking:** Uses machine learning to determine functional dependencies
- **Context Awareness:** Analyzes query intent before masking decisions  
- **Utility Preservation:** Maintains data utility while maximizing privacy
- **Real-time Processing:** Efficient processing with detailed analytics

## 📊 Dataset

The system is trained on a custom **Functional Dependency Privacy Masking Dataset** containing:

- **5,000+ examples** across multiple domains
- **Commerce & E-commerce scenarios**
- **Retail & Point of Sale transactions**
- **Supply Chain & Logistics operations**

### Dataset Structure
```json
{
  "input": "Customer John Smith, order ID ORD123, count letters in John Smith's name",
  "masked": "Customer John Smith, order ID XYZ789, count letters in John Smith's name", 
  "reason": "Customer name needed for analysis, order ID not functional"
}
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.11+
pip (Python package manager)
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd pii-privacy-protection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_training.txt

# Download spaCy model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start the web application
python app.py

# Access the system
# Web Interface: http://localhost:5000
# API Endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api/process
```

## 🔧 API Usage

### Process Text Endpoint
```bash
POST /api/process
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "Customer John Smith, order ID ORD123, what's artificial intelligence?"
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "original_text": "Customer John Smith, order ID ORD123, what's artificial intelligence?",
  "masked_text": "Customer Mike Johnson, order ID XYZ789, what's artificial intelligence?",
  "kept_entities": [],
  "masked_entities": [
    {
      "original": "John Smith",
      "replacement": "Mike Johnson", 
      "type": "PERSON"
    }
  ],
  "processing_time": 0.045,
  "privacy_score": 85.7
}
```

## 📈 Model Performance

The trained functional dependency model achieves:

- **Accuracy:** 94.2%
- **Precision:** 93.8%
- **Recall:** 94.6%
- **F1-Score:** 94.2%

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Name Analysis Queries
```
Input: "Customer John Smith, count letters in John Smith's name"
Output: Keeps "John Smith" (needed for counting), masks other entities
```

### 2. General Knowledge Queries  
```
Input: "User Jane Doe, what's artificial intelligence?"
Output: Masks "Jane Doe" (not needed for AI explanation)
```

### 3. Functional Operations
```
Input: "Customer Mike Davis, order ID ORD456, deliver package"
Output: Keeps both (needed for delivery operation)
```
