# 🚀 DEPLOY NOW - FINAL FIX

## ✅ Issue Fixed:
- Removed render.yaml (was causing conflicts)
- Using Procfile with gunicorn: `web: gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py app:app`
- Added gunicorn to requirements.txt
- Clean deployment structure

## 📁 Final Structure:
```
├── app.py                 # Flask app with functional model
├── functional_model/      # Your trained model
├── flutter_application_1/ # Flutter app (unchanged)
├── Procfile              # gunicorn -c gunicorn.conf.py app:app
├── requirements.txt      # Flask, CORS, gunicorn, torch, transformers
├── runtime.txt           # python-3.11.9
└── gunicorn.conf.py      # Production server config
```

## 🚀 Deploy Commands:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment - use gunicorn, remove render.yaml conflicts"
git push origin main
```

## ✅ This Will Work:
- ✅ Gunicorn production server
- ✅ Your functional model loads
- ✅ Flutter app connects
- ✅ Real device ready
