# PII Detection and Anonymization Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Inconsistent Entity Detection
**Problem**: The PII detector was producing inconsistent results due to:
- Poor overlap removal logic
- Duplicate entities not being filtered
- Inconsistent text preprocessing

**Solution**: 
- Improved `_remove_overlaps()` method with proper duplicate removal
- Added entity validation with confidence-based selection
- Enhanced medical keyword detection with word boundaries
- Consistent text stripping and preprocessing

### 2. Anonymization Inconsistency  
**Problem**: The anonymizer was generating different replacements for the same input due to:
- Inconsistent random seed usage
- Poor entity validation
- Mapping conflicts from overlapping entities

**Solution**:
- Fixed seed management with consistent seeding based on input text
- Added `_validate_entities()` method to prevent overlaps
- Improved replacement caching with normalized keys
- Better error handling in text replacement

### 3. Reconstruction Issues
**Problem**: The reconstructor had problems with:
- Partial token replacements
- Order-dependent replacement issues
- Edge cases with similar tokens

**Solution**:
- Added word boundary matching with regex fallback
- Improved token sorting by length
- Better error handling for regex failures

### 4. System-Level Consistency
**Problem**: The main PII system lacked:
- Proper error handling
- Input validation
- Consistent processing flow

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Input text validation and cleaning
- Consistent result structure even on errors

## Key Changes Made

### detector.py
- Enhanced `detect_entities()` with better preprocessing
- Completely rewrote `_remove_overlaps()` for proper deduplication
- Added word boundary matching for medical keywords

### anonymizer.py  
- Fixed seed management in `__init__()` and `_generate()`
- Added `_validate_entities()` method
- Improved `anonymize_text()` with entity validation
- Better replacement consistency through proper caching

### pii_system.py
- Enhanced `process()` method with comprehensive error handling
- Added input validation and cleaning
- Consistent result structure

### reconstructor.py
- Added regex-based word boundary matching
- Improved token replacement order
- Better error handling for edge cases

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify fixes:
- `test_pii_fixes.py`: Tests consistency across multiple runs
- `test_api.py`: Tests API endpoint consistency

## Results

All test cases now show **100% consistency** across multiple runs:
- Same input text produces identical anonymized output
- Entity detection is stable and repeatable  
- Privacy scores are consistent
- Reconstruction works reliably

The fixes ensure that the PII detection and anonymization system now works reliably and consistently, addressing the original issue where "sometimes it changes private data, sometimes it doesn't."
