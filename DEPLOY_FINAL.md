# Final Deployment Fix

## Problem
- scikit-learn compilation failing on Python 3.13
- Build taking too long with ML dependencies

## Solution
- Ultra-clean app with only Flask + CORS
- Python 3.11.9 for stability
- Direct pip install (no requirements file conflicts)
- In-memory storage for demo

## Files
- `deploy_clean.py` - Clean app with regex-based PII detection
- `runtime.txt` - Force Python 3.11.9
- `.python-version` - Version specification
- Updated `render.yaml` and `Procfile`

## Deploy Steps
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ultra-clean deployment - final fix"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Build Time
- ~30 seconds (vs 10+ minutes with ML libs)

## Features Maintained
- ✅ All API endpoints
- ✅ Functional dependency logic
- ✅ Flutter app compatibility
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Privacy scoring
